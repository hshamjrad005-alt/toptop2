<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack web application for game and app charging. The process began with clarifying the user's requirements, specifically confirming the WhatsApp integration details and the need for a fully Arabic interface with RTL support. The engineer then utilized the  to source relevant images for the website's dynamic banner. A significant initial step involved a bulk file write operation to establish the core React frontend (, ) and FastAPI backend (), including database setup and API routes. Extensive testing followed, covering both backend API endpoints and frontend UI functionalities, including admin panel login and content management. The engineer systematically verified each feature against the initial requirements, culminating in a comprehensive success report, indicating a fully functional MVP ready for use.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Their Importance:**

-   :
    -   **Summary:** This file contains the core FastAPI application. It defines all API endpoints for managing games, news, banners, and handling order submissions. It also includes the logic for user authentication for the admin panel and the integration for sending order details to WhatsApp.
    -   **Changes Made:** Rewritten entirely during the initial bulk write to implement all backend logic, including MongoDB models, CRUD operations for games, news, banners, admin authentication, and the WhatsApp message generation/sending logic. It was designed to fetch  from its  file and expose endpoints prefixed with .

-   :
    -   **Summary:** This is the main React component responsible for rendering the entire user interface. It contains the logic for displaying the main product page with game listings, the dynamic banner, the news ticker, and the admin panel. It handles state management, user interactions, and makes API calls to the backend using .
    -   **Changes Made:** Rewritten entirely during the initial bulk write. It was implemented to support Arabic (RTL) layout, integrate Shadcn UI components, display dynamic content fetched from the backend, handle purchase forms, and manage navigation between the main site and the admin interface. It includes the logic for the carousel and the news ticker.

-   :
    -   **Summary:** This file contains custom CSS rules and Tailwind CSS directives specific to the  component, ensuring the desired visual design, animations, and responsiveness.
    -   **Changes Made:** Rewritten as part of the initial bulk write to apply modern styling, implement animations for the banner and news ticker, and ensure the UI adheres to the specified design guidelines (dark theme, purple accents).

-   :
    -   **Summary:** This file acts as the global stylesheet, importing Tailwind's base, components, and utilities. It also defines custom CSS variables for colors (e.g., , ) that align with the Shadcn UI theme and the overall dark/purple design, and sets global font styles.
    -   **Changes Made:** Modified to include Tailwind imports and define the custom color palette, including dark mode variables, adhering to the general UI design guidelines and color restrictions.
